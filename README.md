Wacky Wanda’s Wicked Weapons
============================

This is a simple ES6 frontend used for demo purposes for the talk
“Chrome Developer Tools: Raiding the Armory”

Here is me giving the talk at Stir Trek 2018:

Speakerdeck:

It makes use of this backend:

https://github.com/gregmalcolm/wacky-wandas-wicked-weapons-api

There are 2 important branches:

#### Branch: fix-it 

The code in a purposefully “broken” state

Note: This branch is subject to rebasings from solutions branch whenever
something changes.

#### Branch: solution

The code with all corrections in place. I’m no longer maintaining it, so it 
may be a little out of date.

Setup
-----

Don’t forget to the start the API first

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
